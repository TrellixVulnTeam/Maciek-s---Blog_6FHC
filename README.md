# Maciek-s---Blog developed during udemy course "The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Django".
Simple blog made with use of Django framework. Includes images in posts, static image in head of homepage, post sorting (newest always on top), comments section (with use of disqus), few redirections to facebook, twitter and "about" page and little bit of bootstrap.

I also hosted it at: http://45.76.143.211/ with use of nginx and gunicorn.
